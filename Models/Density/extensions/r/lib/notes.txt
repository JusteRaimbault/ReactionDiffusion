These two file (JRIEngine.jar and REngine.jar) have been formaly (before rJava 0.9.4) 
included in then rJava package. 
They are now shipped bundeled with the R-Extension to make the installation easier.
They are downloaded from:
http://www.rforge.net/JRI/files/

Makes sense to update them from time to time.
